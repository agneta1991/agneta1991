# Hello World! 👋


 
#### Greetings! My name is ***Agneta Pupienyte***, welcome to my GitHub!
I am currently pursuing a full-stack development program at Microvers. While my experience in the field is currently limited, I am actively trying to expand my knowledge beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and working towards mastering Ruby on Rails, which aligns perfectly with my passion and interest to become Back-End developer.<br>
<br>


## About Me<br>


🌍 I am based in Lithuania (GMT+3)<br>
🔭 As a student, my GitHub repositories are constantly updating with exciting new projects that I complete on a weekly basis. Please take a look at my projects, as almost all of them are deployed!<br>
🌱  Currently, I am refreshing my JavaScript skills within my studies, and in my free time, I am exploring Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br>
💬  If you find my projects interesting and have any questions, feel free to reach out, and we can have a little chat!<br>
📫 You can reach me via email at a.pupienyte@gmail.com.<br>
