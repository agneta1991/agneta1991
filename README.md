# Hello World! 👋


 
#### Greetings! My name is ***Agneta Pupienyte***, welcome to my GitHub!
I am currently pursuing a full-stack development program at Microvers. While my experience in the field is currently limited, I am actively trying to expand my knowledge beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and working towards mastering Ruby on Rails, which aligns perfectly with my passion and interest to become Back-End developer.

## About Me

🌍 I am based in Lithuania (GMT+3), currently studying at Microverse full-stack programming school.
🔭 As a student, my GitHub repositories are constantly updating with exciting new projects that I complete on a weekly basis. Please take a look at my projects, as almost all of them are deployed!<br>
🌱  Currently, I am refreshing my JavaScript skills within my studies, and in my free time, I am exploring Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br>
💬  If you find my projects interesting and have any questions, feel free to reach out, and we can have a little chat!<br>
📫 You can reach me via email at a.pupienyte@gmail.com.<br>

## Projects

#### Here are small descriptions and live demo links to the pinned projects below:

 🥁 🎸 🤩 [Capstone-project](https://agneta1991.github.io/Capstone_project/) <br>

This was my first solo project, where I applied the knowledge I gained from studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for four weeks. The project includes both mobile and desktop versions and allows for easy content adjustment as it is dynamically created.

👩‍💻 💃 🧠  [To-Do-List](https://agneta1991.github.io/to-do-list/dist/)
Here is my most recent project, a simple to-do list webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has localStorage integration, which allows for easy changes and deletions.

👏 📲 🦄 [Awesome-books-with-ES6] (it is not deployed)
I collaborated with Mohamed Roshdy to build this interactive webpage. It allows users to add their favorite books and is built using JavaScript, with code exported as modules for easy reuse in future projects.

🙌 🦩🎀  [Portfolio](https://agneta1991.github.io/Portfolio/)
The Portfolio project is my first project while studying at Microverse. It has mobile and desktop versions and is based on HTML and CSS. It serves as a template for showcasing future projects to the public.
