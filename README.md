# Hello World! 👋


 
#### Greetings! My name is ***Agneta Pupienyte***, welcome to my GitHub!
I am currently pursuing a full-stack development program at Microvers. While my experience in the field is currently limited, I am actively trying to expand my knowledge beyond HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and working towards mastering Ruby on Rails, which aligns perfectly with my passion and interest.

## About Me

🌱  Currently, I am refreshing my JavaScript skills within my studies, and in my free time, I am exploring Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br>
💬  If you find my projects interesting and have any questions, feel free to reach out, and we can have a little chat!<br>
📫 You can reach me via email at a.pupienyte@gmail.com.<br>

## Skills

- Programming Languages: HTML CSS JavaScript.

## Projects

#### Here are some notable projects I've worked on:

 💻 💾 🤩 [Click here to view my very first solo project!](https://agneta1991.github.io/Capstone_project/) <br>

It was my very first solo project from start to finish, where I applied all the knowledge I gained over the 4 weeks of studying HTML & CSS with the basics of JavaScript. This project has both a mobile and desktop version and is dynamically created, making it easy to adjust the content.

👩‍💻 💃 😉  [Click here to view a JavaScript based project!](https://agneta1991.github.io/to-do-list/dist/)
This is my most recent project, a simple to-do list built with JavaScript. It includes localStorage integration, allowing for changes and deletions.
